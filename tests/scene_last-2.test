# Test Scene 2
# A simple scene to test ray-surface intersections
# This defines a simple dice
# There are no transformations in this scene

# Note that I use ambient to set the color of the various materials.
# It is unlikely that a ray tracing program will be able to do the same or 
# indeed to interpret multiple instances of the ambient keyword.  
# To get the same effect, you can assign manually a color to each group of 
# primitives.  In any case, getting the geometry right is the point of this 
# exercise, not the shading.

# Now, I actually define the cube.  Note that to avoid lighting/material 
# calculations, I am just using ambient to define the colors.
# No lighting calculations should be performed since I haven't defined any
